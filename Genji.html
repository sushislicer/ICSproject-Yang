		</div>
		<ul>
			<li> Genji has the best mobility in game, being insanely hard to catch and hit. Remember to use the double jump to hop over targets and crouch to dodge headshots while fighting.</li>
			<li> Most of Genji's abilities and default fire animations actually cancel each other. For example, melee can cancel the shuriken animation and wall climb or dash can cancel the deflect and dragon blade sheathing animation.</li>
			<li> When Genji eliminates an enemy, his dash is reset. Use this to escape a tricky situation after eliminating an enemy.</li>
			<li> Dragonblade resets dash cooldown on use and Genji resets dash cooldown on elimination by default, so use this to dash to new targets after a kill and use dash to quickly stack multiple damage instances on multiple enemies.</li>
			<li> Genji is incredibly weak without his abilities. Be careful not to be hacked by Sombra or to burn out all of your abilities.</li>

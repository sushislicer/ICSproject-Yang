			<ul>
				<li> Symmetra's turrets should be used not only to create kill-gates at chokes, but one or two turrets at a flank could tell your team if anyone is going through the flank.</li>
				<li> Symmetra's turret slow can actually render some unorthodox flanks unusable. Heroes such as Reaper D.Va and Genji can lose part of their effectiveness.</li>
				<li> Barrier can block many disables, and a reactive barrier can blobk a flashbang, a sonic arrow, or even a graviton surge. Use it both offensively by running behind it with primary fire or defensively by reacting to enemy abilities.</li>
				<li> Teleporter only has 6 charges, make sure some of your slower, heavier heroes are using it. When there is no fight, team mates can just walk by themselves back to the point instead of wasting a teleporter charge. When in a fight, heroes with movement abilities should not be taking the teleporter and heroes that can stall/contest should. When teleporter is low on charges, tell your team mates to finish it so you can set up a new one.</li>
				<li> Under attack, Symmetra will say "the teleporter/shield generator" is being attacked! Make sure you get help killing the flanker. Don't forget to protect your teleporter or shield generator flanks with turrets.</li>

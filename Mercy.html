			<p id="p7">"On the battlefield, Lúcio’s cutting-edge Sonic Amplifier buffets enemies with projectiles and knocks foes back with blasts of sound. His songs can both heal his team or boost their movement speed, and he can switch between tracks on the fly."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Lucio is the only hero in the game that has speed boost on. Speeding through a choke point is incredibly important to break a choke. Don't limit amp it up just to healing, for amping speed to break a choke can actually speed your team through most of the chokes in game.</li>
				<li> Go to options, enable backwards wallride. It will keep you in the air for almost forever and adds great mobility.</li>
				<li> Constantly switching between heal and speed is a good idea, for it lets you stay in the air longer and gives a bit of healing to your team.</li>
				<li> Speed boost is also the ultimate disengage tool. Use it and boop to bring your team to safety.</li>
				<li> Jumping off of the map can be useful to make it seem like you suicidied.</li>

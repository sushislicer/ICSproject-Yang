			<ul>
				<li> Winston is used mainly to protect your backline from dive type heroes and to dive the enemy's weak back line. Winston's job is literally to dive the diver.</li>
				<li> Protective barrier is not primarily used as a shield to protect your team, but used as an isolation barrier so that you dive a target, drop the barrier and then isolate that target from the rest of their team.</li>
				<li> In a team fight, barrier is also used to separate the enemy team into two temporarily and make it easier to focus the enemy.</li>
				<li> Jump pack is a big part of your damage output. Makesure you actually land on people. Quick melees are also very important as they do more damage in that one instant than using tesla cannon. Always melee before reloading and after reloading. Reloading while using jump pack is a great idea too.</li>
				<li> Primal rage is mainly used to disrupt the enemy team. Use jump pack to go in, and activate it only when you are about to die to refresh your health bar. Do not use primal rage when your team just used any other disabling ultimate, since that would be a waste. Jump pack is very important in dealing damage in primal rage, so don't forget to use it!</li>

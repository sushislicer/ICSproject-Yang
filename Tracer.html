			<ul>
				<li> Tracer is the most fragile character in the game, in exchange for mobility and a tiny hitbox. If you are not blinking, straffing, crouching and jumping at the same time, you are a dead tracer.</li>
				<li> Get close to enemies that need accuracy to kill you, since this makes it easier to juke them, harder for them to hit you, and maximizes your own damage output at the same time. Avoid getting close to McCree or Reaper though, for Reaper has possibility to just one-shot you and if you get close to McCree you are basically dead.</li>
				<li> Manage your recall well. It's your only defensive ability, and since you have such a small health pool many times you won't even be able to use it before you die. You can use recall to dodge projectiles or big ultimates since the recall time is decently long.</li>
				<li> Use bomb to eliminate high-priority targets only, such as Mercy or Reinhardt. Don't waste bomb on Ana or Widowmaker because you can straight up just kill them without bomb. When using bomb, blink as close as possible to your target, throw the bomb, then recall right after to avoid suicide.</li>
				<li> Using jump while blinking can take you across gaps.</li>

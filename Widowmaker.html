			<ul>
				<li> Grappling hook is Widowmaker's main mobility device. Use it to get to niche places or to get away. A grappling airshot to take out run away targets or back line supports is also a choice, and it makes you look fancy while doing so.</li>
				<li> Venom mine is very good for scouting out flankers or for launching into the enemy team. It actually does decent damage. Becareful, however, that you do not get poisonned by your own mine.</li>
				<li> The automatic rifle does some good damage. It is possible to use it to finish targets that have been quick scoped and only take a tap to eliminate. Remember, if a target is not eliminated when getting out of line of sight, then the kill is unsuccessful. You must finish everything as Widowmaker.</li>
				<li> Listen to the sounds around you while scoped. Makesure you hear the footsteps of flankers.</li>
				<li> Widowmaker has a sensitivity adjustment when in scoped mode. It would help to turn her overall sensitivity higher than normal in order to have normal functions while scoped.</li>

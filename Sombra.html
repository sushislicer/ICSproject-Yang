			<p id="p7">"One of the world's most notorious hackers, Sombra uses information to manipulate those in power. Stealth and debilitating attacks make her a powerful infiltrator."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Sombra has some incredible mobility at her disposal, in fact, she will pretty much always make an escape if you play her well.</li>
				<li> Sombra is meant to be played as an utility character. Focusing on hacking targets who cannot afford to lose their abilities, such as Reinhardt, will absolutely wreck havoc on the enemy team.</li>
				<li> Hack any health pack you can. It denies the enemy flankers of good ways to regenerate health and gives ally flankers incredible sustainability.</li>
				<li> Place your translocator before going in to ensure you always have a way to escape.</li>
				<li> EMP is a guaranteed team fight when used right. Make sure you and the enemy are in position for you to use it. Accidentally leaving key targets, such as mercy, out of the EMP will cause heavy burdens.</li>

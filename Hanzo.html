			<p id="p7">"Hanzoâ€™s versatile arrows can reveal his enemies or fragment to strike multiple targets. He can scale walls to fire his bow from on high, or summon titanic spirit dragons."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Hanzo's arrows hit like logs, but they require extremely good aim in order to actually hit enemies. Since his projectiles are affected by gravity, it is easier to hit arrows from the high ground. Wall climb to achieve this.</li>
				<li> If sonic arrow hits Reinhardt's barrier, when he drops the barrier the sonic will drop to the ground, giving more sonic arrow time. Also, you can shoot a sonic into the air before the round to m=have use of an extra sonic when the round starts.</li>
				<li> Scatter arrow shot at an enemy's feet can deal up to 450 damage, enough to kill most characters and even Zarya.</li>
				<li> Dragonstrike starts as a projectile for a brief window before turning into dragons. Make sure the initial projectile does not get absorbed by D.Va or deflected by Genji. Being stunned while halfway through casting dragonstrike will mean loss of the whole ultimate, so use dragonstrike from a safe position.</li>
				<li> Hanzo can wall climb to juke a pursuer. He can also animation cancel with wall-climb and melee. Melee in between shots at close range to achieve maximum efficiency. As Hanzo, flankers will 100% kill you if you are not at 100% awareness and if your aim is ot on point. When being dived, ask your team to help.</li>

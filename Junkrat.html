			<p id="p7">"Junkratâ€™s area-denying armaments include a Frag Launcher that lobs bouncing grenades, Concussion Mines that send enemies flying, and Steel Traps that stop foes dead in their tracks."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Junkrats bombs bounce 3 times before exploding. His steel trap also bounces off of walls, but not 3 times, unfortunately.</li>
				<li> Junkrat can use his concussive blast as a normal grenade and throw it into the enemy to deal damage, not just making it stick on walls. Junkrat can also use concussive blast to knock an enemy into his steal trap.</li>
				<li> Placing the steel trap on an uphill position can surprise the enemy and has a higher chance of triggering. Make sure you always switch the steel trap position around because enemies aren't going to fall for the same position twice.</li>
				<li> Junkrat's grenades are extremely heavy. He lacks ways to deal with enemies above his position. Try to always get higher ground with rat and spam downwards. You can blast-jump using your concussive mine and even double air jump if you place a mine, wait for its cooldown, then jump and throw your second mine in mid-air for a double concussive jump.</li>
				<li> Your tire is extremely fragile and lacks ability to climb high walls. Make sure the tire is coming down to them or hidden by your team mates, or it is most likely going to be ineffective.</li>

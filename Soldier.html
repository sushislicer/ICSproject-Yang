			<p id="p7">"Armed with cutting-edge weaponry, including an experimental pulse rifle thatâ€™s capable of firing spirals of high-powered Helix Rockets, Soldier: 76 has the speed and support know-how of a highly trained warrior."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Soldier:76 is an incredibly balanced hero, having extra healing and extra mobility at his disposal, all the while being hit-scan. This makes him extremely versatile in any situation and in any team composition. He is also not that difficult to learn, so picking up Soldier is a great starting point.</li>
				<li> Unlike other heroes like Reaper or McCree, he doesn't have a window of vulnerability while he unleashes his ultimate. Use this to suddenly catch enemies off guard without giing them a chance to respond. While in Visor mode, the reload speed is also increased, so popping Visor after emptying your magazine allows for maximum damage output.</li>
				<li> Never forget to drop biotic field while fighting. It will save your life more often than not, and it even usually scare the enemy to back off.</li>
				<li> Helix rockets have good precision and deal devastating damage to the target when hit. Don't be afraid to use it when possible. The rockets are also guided by Tactical Visor, so firing rockets during Visor can deal some great damage.</li>
				<li> Do not waste Visor on one person, unless if they are a high priority target. Visor is incredibly useful against flankers and offense heroes, so save it when your team needs help deleting a really pesky flanker from the fight.</li>

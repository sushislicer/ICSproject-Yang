			<p id="p7">"Zenyatta calls upon orbs of harmony and discord to heal his teammates and weaken his opponents, all while pursuing a transcendent state of immunity to damage."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Zenyatta arguably has the most outplay potential in any support. He outputs insane damage in exchange for no mobility. He is rather easy to pick on by a flanker, but he won't go down without a fight.</li>
				<li> Zenyatta needs to strike a balance between sticking with his team and sitting in the back. He is not as effective when further back however if he is easily focused and killed during a team fight, if he chooses to stay in the front.</li>
				<li> Always call out Zenyatta's discord orbs. Discord is one of Zenyatta's most useful abilities and lets you track the enemy team through walls. Tell your team the enemy's position and who it is that is discorded to focus them.</li>
				<li> Zenyatta makes no sound while moving, however he does make sounds while charging his secondary fire, or jumping. You can be fairly sneaky as Zenyatta. Just remember to not use your secondary fire while doing so.</li>
				<li> Transcendence is amazing and should only be saved as your last resort against enemy offensive combos, in particular against graviton surge. Using Zenyatta's ult against graviton can basically negate its usefulness completely.</li>

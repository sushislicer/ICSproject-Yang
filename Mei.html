			<p id="p7">"Meiâ€™s weather-altering devices slow opponents and protect locations. Her Endothermic Blaster unleashes damaging icicles and frost streams, and she can Cryo-Freeze herself to guard against counterattacks, or obstruct the opposing team's movements with an Ice Wall."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Mei's icewall can be used for many purposes, and mastering its use can be the difference between good and bad Mei players.</li>
				<li> Blizzard goes through barriers. Be careful, however, it doesn't get eaten by D.Va.</li>
				<li> After you freeze a target, go for an icicle headshot. After blizzard, head-icicle the supports first.</li>
				<li> Mei's icewall is espcially devastating when used at the choke point. As soon as enemy enters the choke, block it off to ensure there is no escape and just kill them. A good way to surprise them is to make the wall vertically aligned then hide sideways to the choke and wait for someone to pass.</li>
				<li> Mei's icewall can also be used defensively or for utility. It can be used to shield an enemy ultimate, for example a barrage or a high noon, or to block off the choke when ally barriers are down. It can be used for utility to bring allies like McCree or Bastion that can really appreciate the high ground but normally don't have the means to get to certain places to get to the places they want.</li>

			<p id="p7">"Roadhog uses his signature Chain Hook to pull his enemies close before shredding them with blasts from his Scrap Gun. Heâ€™s hardy enough to withstand tremendous damage, and can recover his health with a short breather."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> The chain is absolutely broken. You can still hook people through cars and walls if you see a tiny bit of their hitbox through the space between the car and the car tires or something. Abuse that.</li>
				<li> If you hook a target, they get pulled to the position you are facing when the hook ends. Hook them, then turn towards a bottomless pit.</li>
				<li> Walk forward and shoot after you hooked someone, so they don't get a chance to back away and live. Besure to melee them even after the shot for some extra finishing damage.</li>
				<li> Pressing R before taking a breather can cancel half of your reload animation.</li>
				<li> Whole Hog is pretty useless in terms of damage but great to push people back into a corner. If the enemy team is grouped up too closely, punish them by putting them into a corner.</li>

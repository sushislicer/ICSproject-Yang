			<ul>
				<li> Bastion is extremely weak in sentry mode. Be extremely careful in this mode, for your hitbox is extremely big and you will need backup.</li>
				<li> Bastion does not move in sentry mode. He is extremely vulnerable to high range high damage heroes such as pharah or widowmaker. Set up somewhere that avoids their line of sight.</li>
				<li> Genji will absolutely murder Bastion. Do not fire into deflect as it will kill you. When facing a Genji, he will use deflect to try and kill you. You must predict when he will use it and stop firing when he does. Then he will try to hop all over you and kill you. If you have a mercy healing you, just ignore him. If you don't, try and kill him. Do not go into recon while Genji is jumping you, for you will die.</li>
				<li> Bastion can rocket-jump with Configuration: Tank. You use this to get to a higher vantage point to setup later.</li>
				<li> You can use Bastion's self heal in between firing in sentry and especially tank mode in order to gain extra health and cancel the firing animation.</li>

			<p id="p3">Defense: 6</p>

			<p id="p7">"Orisa serves as the central anchor of her team, and defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier. She can attack from long range, fortify her own defenses, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Halt used and coordinated correctly can be extremely deadly. Be sure to talk on microphone before using it.</li>
				<li> Use defense matrix to actively block projectiles. Defense matrix should hardly be used to protect your team, but more for eating up specific abilities such as ultimates and to guide the team to a positional advantage.</li>
				<li> Launching a barrier to the sky before the round can provide you with an extra barrier when the round starts.</li>
				<li> Supercharger is incredibly powerful and needs to be carefully protected. Drop it in a secure position in the back that cannot be killed by simple flankers.</li>
				<li> Orisa doesn't have a lot of health, and she's quite immobile, so she's almost like a free target for the enemy. Don't play her as a front line tank but rather a mid range utility that transforms into a front line tank when barrier is off-cooldown.</li>

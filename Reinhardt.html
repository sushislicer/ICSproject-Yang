			<ul>
				<li> Reinhardt has a 2000 health barrier. That is insane. He acts as the primary front-line of the team and his decisions can change the outcome of the round by itself.</li>
				<li> Charge is a massive risk/reward ability. Always tell your team mates when you are going to make a charge play so that they can adapt to it.</li>
				<li> You can drop the barrier for split seconds occasionally in order to let your barrier have some breathing space, tank some damage yourself since you have 500 health, feed your supports some ultimate charge, or even bait out an enemy ultimate.</li>
				<li> Firestrikes should be used carefully. Enemies can use their ultimates and disable your whole team during the firestrike animation.</li>
				<li> Always talk to your team mates. Make sure they understand everything that you are going to do, drop your barrier, firestrike, earth shatter, etc. Don't just blindly swing your hammer.</li>

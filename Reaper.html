			<p id="p7">"His Hellfire Shotguns, the ghostly ability to become immune to damage, and the power to step between shadows make Reaper one of the deadliest beings on Earth."</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Reaper outputs insane damage, being able to one-shot most characters with his shotguns if it is a headshot.</li>
				<li> Try to catch enemies off-guard with Reaper, sneak-up, and just kill them.</li>
				<li> Reaper has extremely short range, however, that does not mean he should shove his face into others. In fact, the perfect distance for Reaper to stand from his target is 5m.</li>
				<li> Reaper is actually quite loud, one of the loudest heroes in game, the other being McCree. Crouching will help reduce the noise when trying to sneak up on people.</li>
				<li> Be careful while using shadow-step, for it could spell your instant doom. Never ever shadow-step to an open plane that enemies have vision on, unless you know they can't do anything about it.</li>

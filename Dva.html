			<ul>
				<li> While D.Va is ejecting, holding down space and a direction lets you eject in that direction.</li>
				<li> Use defense matrix to actively block projectiles. Defense matrix should hardly be used to protect your team, but more for eating up specific abilities such as ultimates and to guide the team to a positional advantage.</li>
				<li> Using self-destruct halfway through boosters lets you laugh self-destruct in a direction.</li>
				<li> D.Va's call-mech actually does damage. In fact, it can kill 200 health heroes pretty well. Only abuse this in a dire situation though, like a 6v1 overtime scenario where you have to contest the point.</li>
				<li> Use D.Va's boosters to displace enemies and disrupt the line. For example, boosters can kill a lot of symmetra turrets, boop the Widow off of the high ground, or boop the Reinhardt forwards and out of position. Use boosters intelligently, because good use of it can lead to winning a fight.</li>

			<ul>
				<li> Alternating between hitscan and projectile use is very important as Ana. You should be primarily healing with projectile but if you need to tag out an enemy or tag a pharah in the sky quickly switching to hitscan is very useful. </li>
				<li> Communication sleep dart is very important. Sleep dart should also not be used as a last resort to avoid being killed, it should be used actively and launched into the choke.</li>
				<li> You are Ana. Not Widowmaker. Don't sit in the back and snipe, because you are most likely just going to kill yourself.</li>
				<li> Coordinate nano-boost. You don't want to boost the Lucio in front of your ulting Genji.</li>
				<li> Boost order: Direct Offense Who have Ultimates Up, then Tanks, then Defense and Supports.</li>

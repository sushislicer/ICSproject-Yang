			<ul>
				<li> Graviton Surge is arguable the best offensive ultimate in the game. It guarantees a team wipe everytime used if used right. Do not waste this ultimate for a solo graviton or a double, because whoever gets caught in graviton dies 100% of the time.</li>
				<li> Getting charges are easy if you are peeking chokes with barrier on. Barrier yourself, walk into choke for 1-2 seconds, then you'll have 40% charge.</li>
				<li> Zarya's secondary barrier for the team mate is extremely useful. It removes the vulnerability that most heroes face while using an offensive ultimate, so the enemy team have no choice but to either break your barrier or hide.</li>
				<li> Barrier is not invincible. Do not overextend, because you will kill yourself.</li>
				<li> Graviton Surge always requires back-up. Make sure your team is there before using it. When launching graviton, make sure the supports are caught in it as well. Letting out a loose mercy could mean a wasted graviton.</li>
